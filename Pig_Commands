This tutorial will enable you to gain a working knowledge of Pig and hands-on experience creating Pig scripts to carry out essential data operations and tasks.
In this tutorial, you will first read in two data files that contain New York Stock Exchange dividend prices and stock prices, and then use these files to perform a number of Pig operations including :

Define a relation with and without schema
Define a new relation from an existing relation
Select specific columns from within a relation
Join two relations
Sort the data using ‘ORDER BY’
FILTER and Group the data using ‘GROUP BY’



Test Data

You’ll need sample data for this tutorial. The data set you will be using is stock ticker data from the New York Stock Exchange from the years 2000-2001. Download this sample data from the following location:
https://s3.amazonaws.com/hw-sandbox/tutorial1/infochimps_dataset_4778_download_16677-csv.zip

The file is about 11 megabytes, and might take a few minutes to download.
Open the folder  infochimps_dataset_4778_download_16677 > NYSE and locate the two data files that you will be using for this tutorial:
NYSE_daily_prices_A.csv
NYSE_dividends_A.csv


Define a relation

STOCK_A = LOAD 'nyse/NYSE_daily_prices_A.csv' using PigStorage(','); DESCRIBE STOCK_A;


Relation with Schema

STOCK_A = LOAD ‘/user/Cloudera/NYSE/NYSE_daily_prices_A.csv' using PigStorage(',') AS (exchange:chararray, symbol:chararray, date:chararray, open:float, high:float, low:float, close:float, volume:int, adj_close:float);
 DESCRIBE STOCK_A;

Specific column

STOCK_A = LOAD ‘/user/cloudera/NYSE/NYSE_daily_prices_A.csv' using PigStorage(',') AS (exchange:chararray, symbol:chararray, date:chararray, open:float, high:float, low:float, close:float, volume:int, adj_close:float); B = LIMIT STOCK_A 100; C = FOREACH B GENERATE symbol, date, close; DESCRIBE C;

Store
STORE C INTO ‘/user/cloudera/NYSE/output/C';

Joins
STOCK_A = LOAD ‘/user/cloudera/NYSE/NYSE_daily_prices_A.csv' using PigStorage(',') AS (exchange:chararray, symbol:chararray, date:chararray, open:float, high:float, low:float, close:float, volume:int, adj_close:float); DIV_A = LOAD 'NYSE_dividends_A.csv' using PigStorage(',') AS (exchange:chararray, symbol:chararray, date:chararray, dividend:float); C = JOIN STOCK_A BY (symbol, date), DIV_A BY (symbol, date); DESCRIBE C;

Sorting

DIV_A = LOAD ‘/user/cloudera/NYSE/NYSE_dividends_A.csv' using PigStorage(',') AS (exchange:chararray, symbol:chararray, date:chararray, dividend:float); B = ORDER DIV_A BY symbol, date asc; DUMP B;

Filter And Group By

DIV_A = LOAD ‘/user/cloudera/NYSE/NYSE_dividends_A.csv' using PigStorage(',') AS (exchange:chararray, symbol:chararray, date:chararray, dividend:float); B = FILTER DIV_A BY symbol=='AZZ'; C = GROUP B BY dividend; DESCRIBE C; DUMP C;
